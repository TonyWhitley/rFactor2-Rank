# rFactor2-Rank
Taking Uwe's original files and purely as an intellectual exercise re-writing the parser with a different algorithm and using OO and TDD (Test Driven Development). It doesn't work any better (except for the error reporting improvements already made on the main branch) but I got satisfaction from writing it.  And being TDD it has unit tests now.  And comments.
